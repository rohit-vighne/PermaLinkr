PermaLinkr adds an item to the Chrome context menu that, when clicked on an element in a webpage, looks up the DOM tree for [fragment identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier). These can be directly scrolled to by adding the hash (#) at the end of the url followed by the `ID` or `name` of the target element. Then, the link is conveniently copied to the clipboard for sharing elsewhere.

PermaLinkr is designed to allow you to share a link to a specific section in a large document, given that the document is annotated enough with `ID` hooks. It was created after I had to go into the Web Inspector one time too many just to link to a specific heading in a long document on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"><abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr></a>, but it can be used many other sites.
