A Chrome extension that lets you generate a permalink to a specific section of a page

PermaLinkr adds an item to the context menu that, when clicked on an element in a webpage, looks up the DOM tree for [fragment identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier). These can be linked to by adding the hash (#) at the end of the url followed by the `ID` or `name` of the target element. Then, the link is copied to the clipboard.

PermaLinkr is designed to allow you to share a link to a specific section in a large document, given that the document is annotated enough with `ID` hooks. I created it after I had to go into the Web Inspector one time too many just to link to a specific heading in a long document on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"><abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr></a>, but it can be used on any site that has enough `ID` attributes on it.
